# Image & Video Tooling

This project provides simple, browser-based tools:

- **FFmpeg Command Generator** (`ffmpeg-command-generator.html`):
  - Visually build complex FFmpeg commands for video/audio processing.
  - Supports drag-and-drop or browsing for input files.
  - Adjust codecs, quality, resize, crop, trim, overlays, audio, and more.
  - Copy the generated command for use in your terminal.

- **AI Image Editor** (`image_editor.html`):
  - Upload, edit, and enhance images with a modern UI.
  - Resize, crop, apply effects, expand canvas, and use AI for alt
    text/captions.
  - Drag-and-drop or click to upload images.
  - Download the edited result in various formats.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/joaocjesus/image-video-tooling.git
